                    Floratech is a project that is bridging Flora and Technology! After years of seeing the state of our atmosphere decline, we felt that it was only right that we would step in and help rebalance the world. We have made the decision of pivoting our research away from medicines and vaccines. Our goal now is to help not only our population, but the Flora and animal population that is suffering.

                    Our current team consists of engineers from Silicon Valley, along side Biologist who dedicate their studies to Mutationism. After years of research, we have finally created a tool to help maintain the byproducts that are essential to our eco-system. Our team has found a way to create a biomechanical generated cell, that we have named T.E.S.T cells. When inserting it into the plant, we are able to detect higly accurate Carbon Dioxide levels within a 300 mile radius. In this current stage of Floratech, the T.E.S.T cells in the plant automatically convert the Carbon Dioxide and generate safe levels of Oxygen.

                    With the high rate of success with our experimentations, we were approved to implement our project outside of our labs on December 23rd of 2018. California is where we implemented the first run of the T.E.S.T cell insertion. Now in California, we are seeing a flattening of the curve, and a decline in the excess Carbon Dioxide in the atmosphere and nice leveling of oxygen.
